# Creating Your First Angular Application üöÄ

 ### Install Node.js and npm üì¶
First, you need to have `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download and install them from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Install Angular CLI. üåê 
`Angular CLI` (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.

```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Create a New Angular Project üèóÔ∏è
Use Angular CLI to create a new Angular project. Replace `my-first-app` with your desired project name.

```bash
    ng new my-first-app
```

### Configuration options üõ†Ô∏è

Select `Sass (SCSS)`

<kbd>
  <img src="https://github.com/MinenhleNkosi/AngularMastery/blob/main/0.%20CreatingFirstApp/Images/0.png" height="auto" width="800" />
</kbd>
<hr>

Select `no` since we are not yet focusing on server-side rendering.

</kbd>

The application was created successfully
<hr>
Or you press `Enter` to accept the default settings.
<hr>

### Navigate to Your Project Directory üìÇ
Change your directory to the newly created project folder.

```bash
    cd my-first-app
```

### Serve the Application üöÄ

```bash
    ng serve
```

By default, the application will be available at [link](http://localhost:4200/). Open your web browser and navigate to this URL to see your new Angular app in action!

# Explore the Project Structure üìÇ.
When you create a new Angular project, the `Angular CLI` sets up a standard folder structure for you. Here's a breakdown of the key folders and files:

### Root Directory üìÇ
1. **e2e/** : This folder contains end-to-end tests for your application. These tests simulate user interactions and verify that the application behaves as expected.

2. **node_modules/** : This folder contains all the npm packages that your project depends on. It is automatically generated when you run `npm install`.

3. **src/** : This is the main source folder where your application code resides. Let's dive deeper into this folder.

### src/ Directory üìÇ
1. **app/** : This folder contains the core application code, including components, services, modules, and other Angular-specific files.

    * **app.component.ts** : The root component of your application. It defines the logic and data for the root component.
    * **app.component.html** : The HTML template for the root component.
    * **app.component.css** : The CSS styles for the root component.
    * **app.module.ts** : The root module that bootstraps the application. It declares and imports other modules and components.

2. **assets/** : This folder is used to store static assets like images, fonts, and other files that you want to be served as they are.

3. **environments/** : This folder contains environment-specific configuration files. By default, it includes `environment.ts` for development and `environment.prod.ts` for production.

4. **styles.css** : This is the global stylesheet for your application. You can add global styles here that apply to your entire application.

5. **index.html** : This is the main HTML file that gets served when someone visits your application. It contains the root `<app-root>` element where your Angular app will be bootstrapped.

6. **main.ts** : This is the main entry point of your application. It bootstraps the root module (`AppModule`) and starts the Angular application.

7. **polyfills.ts** : This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and other libraries to support older browsers.

8. **test.ts** : This is the main entry point for running unit tests. It initializes the Angular testing environment.

9. **favicon.ico** : This is the favicon for your application. You can replace it with your own icon.

### Configuration Files üìÅ
1. **angular.json** : This is the main configuration file for `Angular CLI`. It defines how your application is built and served, including settings for different environments.

2. **package.json** : This file contains `metadata` about your project, including `dependencies`, `scripts`, and other configurations. It is used by `npm` to manage your project's packages.

3. **tsconfig.json** : This is the TypeScript configuration file. It defines the compiler options required to compile your TypeScript code.

4. **tslint.json** : This file contains the configuration for `TSLint`, a static analysis tool for *TypeScript* code. It helps enforce coding *standards* and catch potential *errors*.

### Additional Files üìÅ
1. **.editorconfig** : This file defines coding styles for different editors and IDEs to ensure consistency across your project.

2. **.gitignore** : This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by `Git`. It helps keep your repository clean by excluding unnecessary files.

3. **README.md** :  This is a markdown file that provides an overview of your project. It typically includes instructions on how to set up and run your application.
