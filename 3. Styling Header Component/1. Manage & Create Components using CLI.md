# Angular CLI üñ•Ô∏è
The **Angular CLI** (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that helps developers manage and create Angular applications and components efficiently. Here are some key aspects of managing and creating components with the Angular CLI:

## 1. Installing Angular CLI üî©
First, you need to install the Angular CLI globally on your machine if you haven't already:

```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## 2. Creating a New Angular Project üÜï
To create a new Angular project, use the `ng new` command followed by the project name:

```bash
    ng new my-angular-app
```
This command will prompt you to select various configuration options such as routing and stylesheet format.

## 3. Generating Components üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª
To generate a new component, use the `ng generate component` command (or its shorthand `ng g c`):

```bash
    ng g c my-component
```
This command will create a new directory named `my-component` inside the `src/app` directory with the following files:

* `my-component.component.ts`: The TypeScript file containing the component logic.
* `my-component.component.html`: The HTML template for the component.
* `my-component.component.css`: The CSS file for the component's styles.
* `my-component.component.spec.ts`: The unit test file for the component.

## 4. Serve the Application: To run the application locally, use:

```bash
    ng serve
```

## 5. Build the Application: To build the application for production, use:

```bash
    ng build
```

# Component Structure
Here's a brief overview of the files generated for a component:

1. **TypeScript File** (`.ts`):

    ```ts
        import { Component } from '@angular/core';

        @Component({
            selector: 'app-my-component',
            templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
            styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
        })
        export class MyComponent {
        // Component logic goes here
        }
    ```

2. **HTML Template** (`.html`):

    ```html
        <p>
            my-component works!
        </p>
    ```

3. **CSS File** (`.css`):

    ```css
        /* Component-specific styles go here */
    ```

4. **Unit Test File** (`.spec.ts`):

    ```ts
        import { ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
        import { MyComponent } from './my-component.component';

        describe('MyComponent', () => {
            let component: MyComponent;
            let fixture: ComponentFixture<MyComponent>;

            beforeEach(async () => {
                await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
                declarations: [ MyComponent ]
                })
                .compileComponents();
            });

            beforeEach(() => {
                fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);
                component = fixture.componentInstance;
                fixture.detectChanges();
            });

            it('should create', () => {
                expect(component).toBeTruthy();
            });
        });
    ```


## Enough with fundamentals, let's get back to our application. üòÖ
If you look at the app folder where we created our header component, now if we create another component, another one, and another, etc. We will end up with too many file to manage.

So the best approach is to have a folder structure within the **app** folder, thus for every component created there will be a sub-folder for that specific component. 

To better manage the header component we will create it's own sub-folder and all other component that we will create in the near future will have their own sub-folders. The folder naming should describe what the component feature is, thus we will name the folder **header**.

Our new folder structure for the **app** folder will look like below:

- `app/`
    - `header/`
        - `header.component.css`
        - `header.component.html`
        - `header.component.ts`
    - `app.component.html`
    - `app.component.scss`
    - `app.component.spec.ts`
    - `app.component.ts`
    - `app.config.ts`
    - `app.routes.ts`

Next now that you moved all the header component files, make sure that you update the `app.component.ts` file since that's where the linking takes place. So you should update the directory path to get the newly moved files as below:

```ts
    import { HeaderComponent } from '.header/header.component'; 
```

## Another thing to do to work efficiently with components.
Now it's time to use the **Angular CLI**

Now we want to create a new component for our application such that we can see each user and when we click on any user we can see what tasks they're busy with. To create a new component **user** we will use the below command on our terminal:

```bash
    ng g c user
```

After pressing **Enter**, on the terminal we get the below output which is the sign that indeed our component **user** has been created:

```bash
    CREATE src/app/user/user.component.html (20 bytes)
    CREATE src/app/user/user.component.spec.ts (601 bytes)
    CREATE src/app/user/user.component.ts (239 bytes)
    CREATE src/app/user/user.component.scss (0 bytes)
```

Now our folder structure for the **app** folder is now looking like below:

- `app/`
    - `header/`
        - `header.component.css`
        - `header.component.html`
        - `header.component.ts`
    - `user/`
        - `user.component.scss`
        - `user.component.html`
        - `user.component.spec.ts`
        - `user.component.ts`
    - `app.component.html`
    - `app.component.scss`
    - `app.component.spec.ts`
    - `app.component.ts`
    - `app.config.ts`
    - `app.routes.ts`
